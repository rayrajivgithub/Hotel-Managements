# Hotel-Managements

A user-friendly text-based interface for hotel staff to interact with the system, 
including booking rooms, checking guests in and out,ordering foods and generating bills. This project 
provided hands-on experience in software development, data management, and user 
interaction. It showcases my ability to design and implement practical solutions using C++ 
while adhering to best practices in software development.
